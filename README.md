# Give Anywhere Stardew Valley Mod

This mod allows the player to give an item to another farmhand, no matter where
the other farmhand is located.

## How to use

The default keyboard combination is `Ctrl + G` (G for Give) if you're using a
keyboard, or `BigButton + ControllerA` if you're using a controller. These key
bindings can be changed in the mod's config.json file.
